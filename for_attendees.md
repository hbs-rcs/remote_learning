# Remote Learning Instructions for Workshop Attendees

### Introduction

This document lists points to consider when attending a workshop that offers a remote option
or is taught entirely remotely. Most importantly, **ensure that all required software is
installed and working correctly ahead of time**. As in-person support is not available, it is
imperative that proper planning and sufficient lead time are given to ensure a smooth and
enjoyable class experience. Additionally, we&#39;d like to encourage as much interaction as
possible and when reasonable.

For the purposes of this document, we will highlight solutions in [Zoom](http://zoom.us/),
though solutions exist in other video conferencing software. A number of useful Zoom guides
are available at [Zoom Support](https://support.zoom.us/) and 
[Zoom Support during the COVID-19 pandemic](https://zoom.us/docs/en-us/covid19.html).

### Zoom / Video Conference Setup

Many guides are available online, and we've summarized some of the most important tips here.

1. Setup or verify your computer and learning location a day or two in advance -- the 
   day-of the workshop is not the best time to learn about problems. Test your
   software at [https://zoom.us/test](https://zoom.us/test) and test with a colleague.
   Also see Harvard University IT's Zoom FAQ: [Before I Start](https://huit.harvard.edu/frequently-asked-questions#ui-accordion-2-panel-0) 
   and [Having Problems](https://huit.harvard.edu/frequently-asked-questions#ui-accordion-2-header-2).  

1. If you have a 2nd monitor, use it. Especially if using a laptop. Remember, you'll need
   screen real estate both to see the instructions and then to execute them yourself.

1. Good audio is essential. And good video helps, but is not a deal-breaker.

1. Practice the following items: 
   1. Gallery vs. speaker view
   1. Mute and unmute yourself
   1. Opening and using the chat
   1. Opening and using the Attendees window
   1. Raising and lowering your hand
   1. Sharing your screen, and stopping sharing
   
    Although these seem like simple operations, practicing this when first using Zoom will help
    you understand which settings are not optimal and could be changed.

1. Finally, we may use Zoom's Breakout Rooms feature, so please briefly review Zoom's Guide on 
[Participating in Breakout Rooms](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005769646-Participating-in-Breakout-Rooms).

1. For more detailed Zoom settings recommendations, review 
[our cheatsheet on Zoom settings](zoom_setings.md) to ensure you get the best experience.

### Workshop Preparation

1. **All attendees must install required software and perform any necessary setup
   steps prior to the workshop.** We recommend doing this by 12PM the day before to allow enough 
   time for you (and all the other attendees) to secure tech support from the training team.

1. If you cannot verify that all required software works correctly, please email the
   [Research Inbox at research@hbs.edu](mailto:research@hbs.edu?subject=Pre-workshop%20tech%20support) 
   and we will schedule a 1-on-1 Zoom session with you for troubleshooting.
 
1. Please communicate with the instructor or workshop organizers if you have any accessibility
   concerns, and we will work to support you.

1. Also, let us know via the [Research Inbox at research@hbs.edu](mailto:research@hbs.edu?subject=Workshop%20preferences) 
   if you will be attending the workshop with a colleague and wish to work together during the session.


### Day of Class - Getting Started

Some thoughts and simple guidelines:

1. In addition to the instructor, one or two helpers will be on-hand to guide the class and
   offer support: a primary helper, the Zoom session host, and a secondary helper. Feel free
   to address the instructor, and helpers will assist as needed.
   
1. Get comfortable!

1. If possible, reboot your computer before joining the class.

1. Remove distractions (other open programs, browser tabs, etc) and mute or turn on the 
   'Do Not Disturb' function on your computer and phone.

1. Please turn on your video so that everyone can experience who you are, and so that the
   instructor can read your body language during the workshop. But feel free to turn off
   your video during breaks or should you need to attend to something.

1. Mute yourself when entering the class and when not talking.

1. When interacting, speak clearly and be specific. 

1. Do be mindful of the class and Zoom etiquette, esp. if reviewed at the class start, as each
   class and instructor is different.

### Day of Class - Questions &amp; Exercises

1. If you have a question, use the Raise Hand function, type '/hand' in the Chat window, 
   or use the instructor's preferred method.

1. Make use of the chat when appropriate. This can also be saved at the end of the workshop if
   you found the dialog helpful.

1. The instructor may use Breakout Rooms to foster collaboration and interaction. Know that
   you can ask the instructor for help from within the breakout room; and also can leave 
   the breakout room at any time.

1. If you wish to change breakout rooms or not participate in them, please notify the session
   host. Remember that you can turn off your video and / or audio at any time.


### Day of Class - Help and Support


1. The instructor will likely convey her/his preferences for getting or offering help. This
   could include using the *Raise Hand* button in Attendees Window, or typing *'/hand'* in 
   the Chat window 

1. Make use of the chat when appropriate.

1. Don't be afraid to help solve problems. Although the instructor(s) and helpers are
   knowledgeable, everyone has knowledge gaps, and community problem-solving usually results
   in better outcomes.

1. Be aware that the instructor may ask you to share your screen if you are experiencing a
   problem. Do not fear -- this ask might be a teachable moment, as others may be having the
   same problem or this might be a problem that researchers frequently experience. However,
   you are never required to share and should politely decline if you do not wish to
   participate in this way.

1. The helpers may use Breakout Rooms to do 1-on-1 troubleshooting, may ask you to share your
   screen with them, and take over control of your mouse and keyboard. Be comfortable helping
   them with these functions.

Last but not least, don't forget to have fun!!
