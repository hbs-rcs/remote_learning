# Remote Learning Instructions for Workshop Attendees

### Introduction

This document lists points to consider when attending a workshop that offers a remote option
or is taught entirely remotely. Most importantly, **ensure that all required software is
installed and working correctly ahead of time**. As in-person support is not available, it is
imperative that proper planning and sufficient lead time are given to ensure a smooth and
enjoyable class experience. Additionally, we&#39;d like to encourage as much interaction as
possible and when reasonable.

For the purposes of this document, we will highlight solutions in [Zoom](http://zoom.us/),
though solutions exist in other video conferencing software. A number of useful Zoom guides
are available at [https://support.zoom.us/](https://support.zoom.us/).

### Zoom / Video Conference Setup

Many guides are available online, and we've summarized some of the most important tips here.

1. Setup or verify your computer and learning location a day or two in advance. Test your
   software at [https://zoom.us/test](https://zoom.us/test) and with a colleague. The day-of
   is not the best time to learn about problems!

1. If you have a 2nd monitor, use it. Especially if using a laptop. Remember, you'll need
   screen real estate to both see the instructions and then to execute it yourself.

1. Good audio is essential. And good video helps, but is not a deal-breaker.

1. Practice the following items: 
   1. Gallery vs. speaker view
   1. Mute and unmute yourself
   1. Opening and using the chat
   1. Opening and using the Attendees window
   1. Raising and lowering your hand
   1. Sharing your screen, and stopping sharing
   
Although these seem like simple operations, practicing this when first using Zoom will help
you understand which settings are not optimal and could be changed.

Finally, we may use Zoom's Breakout Rooms feature, so please briefly review Zoom's Guide on 
[Participating in Breakout Rooms](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005769646-Participating-in-Breakout-Rooms).

For more detailed Zoom settings recommendations, review 
[this guide on Zoomsettings](zoom_setings.md) to ensure you get the best experience.

### Workshop Preparation

1. We require that all attendees install required software and perform any necessary setup
   prior to the work. We recomemnd doing this by 12PM the day before to allow enough time for
   you (and all the other attendees) to secure tech support from the training team.

1. If you cannot verify that all required software works correctly, please email the
   [Research Inbox at research@hbs.edu](mailto:research@hbs.edu?subject=Pre-workshop%20tech%20support) 
   and we will schedule a 1-on-1 meeting with you via Zoom for troubleshooting.
 
1. Please communicate with the instructor or workshop organizers if you have an accessibility
   concern and we will work to support you.

1. Please email the
   [Research Inbox at research@hbs.edu](mailto:research@hbs.edu?subject=Pre-workshop%20tech%20support) 
   to let us know if you will be attending the workshop with a colleague and wish to work
   together during the workshop.


### Day of Class - Getting Started

Some simple guidelines

1. Get comfortable!

1. If possible, reboot your computer before joining the class.

1. Remove distractions (other open programs, browser tabs, etc) and turn on Do Not Disturb
   function on your computer and phone, if possible.

1. Please turn on your video so that others can fully experience you, and so that the
   instructor can read your body language during the workshop.

1. Mute yourself when entering the class and when not talking

1. When interacting, speak clearly and be specific. 

1. Do be mindful of the class and Zoom etiquette, esp. if reviewed at the class start, as each
   class and instructor is different.

### Day of Class - Questions &amp; Exercises

1. Use the Raise Hand function, type '/hand' in the Chat window, or the instructor's
   preference if you have a question.

1. Make use of the chat when appropriate. This can also be saved at the end of the workshop if
   you found the dialog helpful.

1. The instructor may use Breakout Rooms to foster collaboration and interaction. Know that
   one can ask the instructor for help from within the room, and leave the room at any time.

1. If you wish to change Breakout Rooms or not participate, please let the instructor know.
   Remember that you can always turn off your video and / or audio at any time.


### Day of Class - Help and Support

1. Know that at least one to two helpers will be present to offer assistance, in addition to
   the instructor

1. The instructor will likely convey their preferences for getting or offering help. 

1. Make use of the chat when appropriate.

1. Don't be afraid to help solve problems. Although the instructors and helpers are
   knowledgeable, everyone has knowledge gaps, and community problem-solving usually results
   in a better answer.

1. Use the *Raise Hand* button in Zoom, or type *'/hand'* in the Chat window (as per
   instructor's preference) if you have a question.

1. Be aware that the instructor may ask you to share your screen if you are experiencing a
   problem. Do not fear -- this ask might be a teachable moment, as others may be having the
   same problem or this might be a problem that researchers frequently experience. However,
   you are never required to share and should politely decline if you do not wish to
   participate in this way.

1. The helpers may use Breakout Rooms to do 1-on-1 troubleshooting, may ask you to share your
   screen with them, and take over control of your mouse and keyboard. Be comfortable helping
   them with these functions.

Last but not least, don't forget to have fun!!
