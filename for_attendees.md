# Remote Learning Thoughts for Workshop Attendees

### Introduction

This document is an attempt to list all many points that need to be considered when attending
 a class that offers a remote option or is taught entirely remotely.  As in-person support is
  not available, it is imperative that proper planning and sufficient lead time are given to
   ensure a smooth and enjoyable class experience. Additionally, we&#39;d like to encourage
    as much interaction as possible and when reasonable.

For the purposes of this document, we will highlight solutions in [Zoom](http://zoom.us/),
 though likely solutions exist in other video conferencing software.

We recommend the following guides on remote learning for reading:

### Zoom / Video Conference Setup

Many guides are available online since this mass transition to online work, teaching, and
 learning. We do recommend the ones above, but the following tips are highly recommended

1. Setup or verify your computer and learning location a day or two in advance, and test it
 out with a colleague. The day-of is not the best time to learn about problems.

1. If you have a 2nd monitor, use it. Especially if using a laptop. Remember, you'll need
 screen real estate to both see the instructions and then to execute it yourself.

1. Good audio is essential. And good video helps, but is not a deal-breaker.

1. Review [this guide on Zoom settings](zoom_setings.md) to ensure you get the best experience.

1. Practice the following items: 
   1. Gallery vs. speaker view
   1. Mute and unmute yourself
   1. Opening and using the chat
   1. Opening and using the Attendees winow
   1. Raising and lowering your hand
   1. Sharing your screen, and stopping sharing
   
Although these seem like simple operations, practicing this when first using Zoom will help
 you understand which settings are not optimal and could be changed.

Finally, we may use Zoom's Breakout Rooms feature, so please briefly review Zoom's Guide on [Participating in Breakout Rooms](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005769646-Participating-in-Breakout-Rooms).

### Workshop Preparation

1. We require that all attendees install required software and perform any necessary setup
 prior to the work. And we recomemnd doing this by 12p the day before, which allows enough
  time for you (and all the other attendees) to secure tech support from the training team. 

1. If you cannot meet the points of a successful installation, please contact the [Research Inbox](mailto:research@hbs.edu?subject=Pre-workshop%20tech%20support) and we will schedule
a 1-on-1 meeting with you via Zoom for troubleshooting.
 
1. Please communicate with the instructor or workshop organizers if you have an accessibility
concern, and if you wish to work with a colleague during the workshop.


### Day of Class - Getting Started

Some simple guidelines

1. Get comfortable

1. If possible, reboot your computer before joining the class.

1. Remove distractions (other open programs, browser tabs, etc) and turn on Do Not Disturb function on your computer and phone, if possible. 

1. Please turn on your video so that others can fully experience you, and so that the instructor
can read your body language during the workshop.

1. Mute yourself when entering the class and when not talking

1. When interacting, speak clearly and be specific. 

1. Do be mindful of the class and Zoom etiquette, esp. if reviewed at the class start, as
 each class and instructor is different.

### Day of Class - Questions &amp; Exercises

1. Use the Raise Hand function, type '/hand' in the Chat window, or the instructor's preference
 if you have a question.

1. Make use of the chat when appropriate. This can also be saved at the end of the workshop
if you found the dialog helpful.

1. The instructor may use Breakout Rooms to foster collaboration and interaction. Know that
one can ask the instructor for help from within the room, and leave the room at any time.

1. If you wish to change Breakout Rooms or not participate, please let the instructor know.


#### Day of Class - Help and Support

1. Know that at least one to two helpers will be present to offer assistance, in addition to the instructor

1. The instructor will likely convey their preferences for getting or offering help. 

1. Make use of the chat when appropriate.

1. Don't be afraid to help solve problems. Although the instructors and helpers are knowledgeable, 
everyone has knowledge gaps, and community problem-solving usually results in a better answer.

1. Use the Raise Hand function, type '/hand' in the Chat window, or the instructor's preference
 if you have a question.

1. Be aware that the instructor may ask you to share your screen if you are experiencing a problem.
Do not fear -- this ask might be a teachable moment, as others may be having the same problem or this
might be a problem that researchers frequently experience.

1. The helpers may use Breakout Rooms to do 1-on-1 troubleshooting, may ask you to share your
screen with them, and take over control of your mouse and keyboard. Be comfortable helping
them with these functions.


Last but not least, don't forget to have fun!!
