# Remote Learning

This repository is an opportunity to provide guidance and some best practices about how to
transition our in-class, Carpentries-style instruction to completely remote, online learning.

We also wish to provide some pointers for our Attendees, as this is a significant shift for
them as well.

We hope people find this document helpful and useful, and we encourage comments, corrections,
and suggestions via the [GitHub Issues](/issues), or via our Research Inbox (research@hbs.edu).

All the best,<br>
