# Remote Larning

This repository is opportunity to provide guidance and some best practices about how to
transition our in-class, Carpentries-style instruction to compeltely remote, online learning.

We also wish to provide some pointers for our Attendees, as this is a significant shift for
them as well.

We hope people find this document helpful and useful, and we encourage comments, corrections,
and suggestions via the GitHub Issues, or via our Research Inbox (research@hbs.edu).

All the best,
