## Remote Learning

This repository contains guidance and some best practices to both instructors and attendees for 
transitioning our in-class, Carpentries-style instruction to completely remote, online learning.

This is a significant shift for all persons, and for that reasons, we are providing information
that will help with preparation and in-class learning. These resources are not exhaustive; and
we urge the community to contribute (see below).

* [Guidelines for Instructors](for_instructors.md)
* [Guidelines for Attendees](for_attendees.md)
* Preparation and In-class Checklists
* [Recommended Zoom Settings](zoom_settings.md)
