## Remote Learning

This repository contains guidance and some best practices for both instructors and attendees in 
order to transition our in-class, [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/workshops/)-style instruction 
to completely remote, online learning.

This is a significant shift for all persons, and for that reasons, we are providing information
that will help with preparation and in-class learning, with the goal of not only maximizing
the learning potential but also to provide an comfortable, social learning experience.
These resources are not exhaustive; and we urge the community to contribute (see below).

* [Guidelines for Instructors](for_instructors.md)
* [Guidelines for Attendees](for_attendees.md)
* Preparation and In-class Checklists
  * [Checklist for Attendees](checklist_attendees.md)
  * [Checklist for Instructors](checklist_instructors.md)
* [Recommended Zoom Settings](zoom_settings.md)
