**Remote Teaching Considerations for Instructors**

### Introduction

This document is an attempt to list all many points that need to be considered when planning and executing a class that offers a remote option or is taught entirely remotely.A s all execution points must include remote attendees, it is imperative that proper planning and sufficient lead time are given to ensure a smooth and enjoyable class experience for the instructor, helper(s), and the learners. Additionally, we&#39;d like to ensure that we enable as much interaction as possible and when reasonable.

For the purposes of this document, we will highlight solutions in [Zoom](http://zoom.us/), though likely solutions exist in other video conferencing software.

We recommend the following guides on remote teaching and learning for reading:

### Presenter Materials Preparation

1. Remember that you will only have your computer, your video camera, files, and software applications to convey your workshop &amp; its teaching objectives. One can, but it is difficult to use a pointer. And there is no whiteboard on which to draw. Some video conference programs have an online whiteboard, but practice using this before you intend to do so.
2. Ensure you have an electronic copy of all handouts. This should be delivered with your reminder notice.
3. The instructor and primary helper should coordinate to schedule the meeting and ensure that the RCS Coordinator has the class information. That can be included in the RCS Training Outlook calendar entry.

### Attendee Technology Setup: At least 3 Days Prior to Class

1. Students will receive reminders from Saba/Harvard Training Portal that are auto-generated. When communicating with your registrants, ensure that you are clear on which reminders you are referencing -- HTP-generated reminders versus ones that originate from RCS or instructors.
2. Three to seven days prior to class, send out the class reminder and additional information:
   2. Installation instructions, or link to instructions. These should include measures of success: &#39;your installation is correct if you see this on your screenâ€¦&#39;
   2. Include information on pre-class support &amp; contact person: If attendees do not have a successful installation, they must contact the instructor or class support person \*the day prior\* to the class. _It will be very hard to provide on-the-spot installation support at the very start of class, so we expect students to be prepared in_ _advance_ _of the class._
   2. Include a document of Zoom setup and expected behavior/etiquette. Attendees should ensure the Zoom client is installed, and their microphone and video camera work. Attendees should also know how to screen share within Zoom and to invite another person to control his/her computer.
   2. Include any handouts or links to handouts.
3. Please verify with Liz that \*all\* attendees have an email address registered in the HTP.

### Day Prior to Class

1. The day prior, schedule 30-minute tech support sessions via Zoom with your support / teaching team, and ensure that your video conferencing software has the &#39;remote help desk&#39; or &#39;take control&#39; option turned on.
2. Please send out the reminder notice again. Since there is often turnover in confirmed attendees due to drop outs, it is necessary that everyone receive the instructions several times.

### Day of Class - Getting Started

1. Be prepared to have fun, despite the gymnastics ahead!
2. One helper will be primary to monitor Chat, Attendees window changes, and coordinate Breakout Rooms used for isolated technical support.
3. When starting the Zoom meeting session:
  3a Change the session options to ensure all persons when entering are muted. Click on Manage Attendees \&gt; Attendees window More button \&gt; select &quot;Mute Attendees Upon Entry&quot;. You may wish to make other settings changes here as well.
  3b Create an initial set of two breakout rooms with &#39;manual&#39; assignment. This will allow both helpers /attendees to jump into a breakout room by assignment from the primary helper or by choice from the attendee.
4. For larger classes, ensure that everyone entering the video call has their microphone muted unless they are talking. Communicate that all should have their mic muted when not talking.
5. Communicate that you strongly encourage everyone to turn on their video, as if they were present there in the class. But do give individuals permission to turn off video as needed (eating, taking a break, etc). Please also suggest that alternative backgrounds and the &#39;touch up appearance&#39; setting can be used if people feel at all uncomfortable.
6. Per our usual routine, after introducing yourself and your skills / background, have everyone say a few words about themselves. Encouraging attendees talking and talking to one another early helps create a more friendly, conducive learning environment, so that all feel engaged and more comfortable participating.
7. Finally, set expectations and norms around the usage of Zoom and behavior. Do show students the difference between speaker view and gallery view, so each can choose one&#39;s preferred setting, and other settings that might help with the remote learning experience.

### Day of Class - Questions &amp; Exercises

1. For in-class questions, persons should type in the chat window &quot;/hand&quot;, &quot;/hand[topic]&quot;, or &quot;/q[insert question]&quot;. This captures the queue of questions.
  1a Whoever is the primary chat monitor should then bring this question to the attention of the presenter if not noticed. There is also the &#39;Hand Up&#39; option in the Attendees window, but this can be hard to spot and doesn&#39;t preserve order. Of course, which process used is at the discretion of the instructor.
  2a We suggest that the instructor then acknowledge the person and encourage her to ask the question. This process adds variety to the online experience and facilitates broad participation by all attendees.
2. Preserving the conversation of the class can also be helpful, esp. as there are multiple focal points that everyone must track (notes, chat, video, one&#39;s own work/analysis environment, etc). To help:
  2a You might also consider a Google Doc, EtherPad, or some other shared document for tracking questions and answers. This can be a good follow-up transcript of the class, and also allows you to manage the order of questions.
  2b Alternatively, if using Zoom or another video conferencing service, change the default settings so that the chat transcript is automatically saved when the session ends on the call host&#39;s computer or in the cloud. For Zoom, choose Settings \&gt; Advanced Features \&gt; View Advanced Features \&gt; Settings \&gt; In Meeting (Basic) \&gt; Auto saving chats.
3. When asking questions of the group for check-ins for formative assessments, use the chat to have them type responses or, if brief enough, use the Zoom Polling feature. This can be easier to track &amp; see than responses in the Attendees window. One can always call out an individual to explain more via audio.
4. As attendees may be accustomed to working with a colleague or neighbor on exercises, we should offer the same possibility for remote classes as well. This can be introduced to the class as an option at the beginning of the class or at Exercises time. Breakout rooms can be assigned manually; or if there is consensus from the class, the host (primary helper) can randomly assignment people to breakout rooms (sorry, one cannot use both options). Be sure to use all the Breakout Room options, esp. &quot;Allow participants to return to the main session at any time&quot;.
5. For breaks and exercises, use an on-screen timer so all attendees know how much time remains. And reconvene the class by saying &#39;hello&#39;.

### Day of Class - Support

Providing technical support to an attendee can be a difficult task -- though neither perfect nor exhaustive, here are some suggestions on how can one be effective at guiding troubleshooting while not distracting the class:

1. It is best to have the primary helper be the host of the class, as this person has primary responsibility for the breakout rooms, where a helper and attendee can pair up if needed.
2. For individualized support:
  2a A person should type &quot;I have a problem&quot; in chat. An available helper can respond &quot;I&#39;ll help you&quot; to Everyone (the default chat audience), and then click on the person&#39;s name in the chat window to begin a private chat.
  2b If needed the two persons can hop into a breakout room in order for more focused support. If an attendee cannot start a breakout room on her own, contact the primary helper to send the relevant persons to a single break room.
  2c The primary helper can also join a breakout room by clicking on the &quot;Open Rooms&quot; button in the Breakout Rooms window after assignment or attendee/helper self-assignment, and then clicking on the word &quot;Join&quot; next to the breakout room name.
  2d Once inside the room, screen sharing and remote control options are available to all persons to facilitate giving full support.
  2e Both should be able to leave the breakout room at any time. This setting is controlled by the host (primary helper).
  2f Once the helper and attendee have rejoined the main room, the attendee will likely need some catching up, which the helper can do with a few messages via private chat.
