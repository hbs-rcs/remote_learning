# Remote Teaching Considerations for Instructors

### Introduction

This document is an attempt to list all many points that need to be considered when planning 
and executing a class that offers a remote option or is taught entirely remotely. As all 
execution points must include remote attendees, it is imperative that proper planning and 
sufficient lead time are given to ensure a smooth and enjoyable class experience for the 
instructor, helper(s), and the learners. Additionally, we&#39;d like to ensure that we 
enable as much interaction as possible and when reasonable.

For the purposes of this document, we will highlight solutions in [Zoom](http://zoom.us/),
though likely solutions exist in other video conferencing software.

We recommend the following guides on remote teaching and learning for reading:

### Presenter Materials & Preparation

1. Remember that you will only have your computer, your video camera, files, and software 
   applications to convey your workshop &amp; its teaching objectives. One can, but it is 
   difficult to use a pointer. And there is no whiteboard on which to draw. Some video 
   conference programs have an online whiteboard, but practice using this before you intend 
   to do so.
   
1. Ensure you have an electronic copy of all handouts. This should be delivered with your 
   reminder notice.
   
1. The instructor and primary helper should coordinate to schedule the Zoom session and ensure 
   that the RCS Coordinator has the class information. That can be included in the RCS 
   Training Outlook calendar entry. 
   
1. Recommended Zoom settings (Advanced Options) when scheduling the Zoom session include:
   * Enable Waiting Room - Off
   * Enable join before host - On
   * Mute participants on entry - On
   * Only authenticated users can join - Off
   * Automatically record meeting - On
   * Alternative Hosts: optional to put the 2ndary helpers email address here
   

### Attendee Technology Setup (>= 3 Days Prior to Class)

Note: Students will receive reminders from Saba/Harvard Training Portal that are auto-generated.
When communicating with your registrants, ensure that you are clear on which reminders you
are referencing -- HTP-generated reminders versus ones that originate from RCS or instructors.

1. Three to seven days prior to class, send out the class reminder, obtaining the list of 
   registrants from the RCS Coordinator.
   
1. Verify with the RCS Coordinator that \*all\* attendees have an email address 
   registered in the Harvard Training Portal.

1. The class reminder email should contain the following (additional) information:
   1. *Installation instructions, or link to instructions*. These should include measures of 
      success: &#39;your installation is correct if you see this on your screen…&#39;
   1. *Include information on pre-class support &amp; contact person*: If attendees do not 
      have a successful installation, they must contact the instructor or class support
      person \*the day prior\* to the class. _It will be very hard to provide on-the-spot 
      installation support at the very start of class, so we expect students to be prepared 
      in_ _advance_ _of the class._
   1. *Include a document of Zoom setup and expected behavior/etiquette*. Attendees should 
      ensure the Zoom client is installed, and their microphone and video camera work. 
      Attendees should also know how to screen share within Zoom and to invite another 
      person to control his/her computer.
   1. *Include handouts or links* to handouts.
   1. Ask to attendees to *relay any accessibility concerns*.
   1. Also ask the attendees *if they wish to be paired with a work colleague* during exercises
      using breakout rooms.
   

### Presenter & Helper Technology Setup

1. The primary helper should be the host of the class, and thus has sole control of
   the breakout rooms.

1. Both helpers should work with the instructor to monitor Chat, Attendees window changes
   (e.g. raised hands), research solutions to in-class problems, and generally support the
   instructor to ensure the class runs smoothly. The host and co-hosts also have the ability
   to join breakout rooms and move among them freely.
   
1. The instructor should decide with the helpers on how to field questions. For in-class 
   questions, there are several approaches, each with pros and cons.
   * Attendees can use the Raise/Lower Hand function in the Participants windows. This is
     pretty easy once the window is open. But for multiple questions, one cannot discern the
     order of hands.
   * Attendees can type in the chat window &quot;/hand&quot;, &quot;/hand[topic]&quot;, 
     or &quot;/q[insert question]&quot;. This option captures the queue of questions, and 
     also gives a running log of what transpired. *This is likely the best option for those
     with accessibility concerns or using screen readers.*
   * Attendees can simply unmute themselves and interrupt the instructor.
   
1. No matter the method, the process used is at the discretion of the instructor, and this
   should be discussed at the class start with the Zoom/class norms.
   
1. Preserving the conversation of the class can also be helpful, esp. as there are multiple 
   focal points that everyone must track (notes, chat, video, one&#39;s own work/analysis 
   environment, etc). Consider:
   * Use a Google Doc, EtherPad, or some other shared document for 
     tracking questions and answers. This can be a good follow-up transcript of the class, 
     and also allows you to manage the order of questions.
   * Use chat for questions for the instructor, minor questions for everyone, and sidebar 
     conversations (if allowed). It is especially helpful to save the chat transcript:
     * Encourage the attendees to save the chat themselves before the class ends.
     * Change the default settings so the chat transcript is automatically saved 
       when the session ends. For Zoom, choose Settings &gt; Advanced 
      Features &gt; View Advanced Features &gt; Settings &gt; In Meeting (Basic) &gt; Auto 
      saving chats.

1. Via the class reminder and at the start of exercises, offer to pair up colleagues
   while working on exercises in breakout rooms. Breakout rooms can be assigned manually
   prior to the class or on-the-fly. 
   

### Day Prior to Class

1. Schedule 30-minute tech support sessions via Zoom with your support / 
   teaching team, and ensure that the video conferencing software has the &#39;remote help 
   desk&#39; or &#39;take control&#39; option turned on.
   
1. Send out the reminder notice again. Since there is often turnover in confirmed 
   attendees due to drop-outs, it is necessary to send the instructions 
   several times.
   
1. If sufficient time and the class list is final, prepare the breakout rooms in advance.

1. If using in-class Polls, if possible set those up prior to the class as well.


### Day of Class - Getting Started

1. Be prepared to have fun, despite the gymnastics ahead!

1. When starting the Zoom meeting session:
   * Ensure that all persons entering the session are muted: Click on
     Manage Attendees &gt; Attendees window More button &gt; select &quot;Mute Attendees
     Upon Entry&quot;. You may wish to make other settings changes here as well.
   * Create an initial set of (at least) two breakout rooms with &#39;manual&#39; assignment.
     This will allow both helpers /attendees to jump into a breakout room by assignment from
     the primary helper or by choice from the attendee.
   * Make the instructor and other helper co-hosts of the session.

1. Start the session early, as people may need time to adjust and get comfortable. Similarly,
   offer to linger after class to answer questions.
      
1. Ensure that everyone entering the session has their microphone muted, and should remain
   muted unless talking. 
   
1. Welcome everyone and briefly introduce yourself.

1. Briefly communicate the Zoom session norms:
   * All should have their mic muted when not talking.
   * Strongly encourage everyone to turn on their video.
   * Show attendees names on the video screens, and ask to rename them if needed
   * State how the chat can or should be used.
   * Communicate your preference for requesting help.
   
   Note: Using video in class for all attendees is strongly recommended, as if they were
   present there in the class. But do give individuals permission to turn off video as
   needed (eating, taking a break, etc). Please also suggest that alternative backgrounds
   and the &#39;Touch up appearance&#39; setting can be used if people feel at all uncomfortable.

1. Have everyone say a few words about themselves after introducing yourself and your 
   skills / background. Include the helpers in these introductions as well. Both encouraging 
   attendees to talk and to talk to one another early helps create a more friendly, 
   conducive learning environment, so that all feel engaged and more comfortable participating.
   
1. Optionally point out some of the Zoom features after the introductions and 
   expectations/norms. Do show students the difference between Speaker and Gallery Views
   (so each can choose one&#39;s preferred setting) and other settings that might help with
   the remote learning experience.


### Day of Class - Questions &amp; Exercises

1. The helpers can notify the instructor on raised hands or if questions are posted in chat.

1. Do call on the attendee by name, and direct her to ask the question either via unmuting
   or posting it in chat. This process adds variety to the online experience and facilitates 
   broad participation by all attendees.

1. Use the chat window, poll feature, or raised hands for check-ins and formative assessments;
   and mix it up! Using the chat provides a history that can be saved. And polling can be 
   done on-the-fly or with questions prepared in advanced.
   
1. Use methods to encourage full participation:
   * Have students indicate -1, 0, or +1 in the chat for their thoughts on their progress or 
     their agreement with a given question.
   * Use different phrases or questions to reach different groups of attendees:
     * "Can I get about 3 people wanting to talk who haven’t yet?"
     * "Who is new to XXX that might want to answer this?""
     * "Who's not feeling it? You've got the floor."
   * Take the opportunity to call out an individual to explain more via audio.

1. Remind people about the use of breakout rooms when starting exercises. These can be 
   assigned manually prior to class or on-the-fly. If there is 
   consensus from the class, the host can randomly assign people to the rooms 
   (sorry, one cannot use both options).
   
1. Be sure to verify all the Breakout Room options, (the Options button in the Breakout Rooms
   window) esp. &quot;Allow participants to return to the main session at any time&quot;.

1. Break every hour; and for breaks and exercises, use an on-screen timer so all attendees
   know how much time remains. Reconvene the class by saying &#39;hello&#39;.


### Day of Class - Support

Providing technical support to an attendee can be a difficult task -- though neither 
perfect nor exhaustive, here are some suggestions on how can one be effective at guiding 
troubleshooting while not distracting the class:

1. If a person requires assistance in class
   * She should get the attention of the instructor or helpers via the class Zoom norms.
   * Call on the attendee by name and have her explain the problem.

1. Make use of teachable moments. If this is a problem that other students have or is a 
   problem that researchers commonly have, and this can be handled in less than 2 or 3 minutes,
   solve the problem together with the class via Screen Sharing and/or Remote Control.
   Everyone benefits from problem solving in real-time. Also encourage capable class members
   to help find, review, and recommend solutions. But do allow the person to politely
   decline the public assistance.
   
1. Use private chats to help troubleshoot other problems. Click on the name of the person in 
   chat or select Chat in the Attendee window or on the video of the person. This will redirect
   future chat messages to that person only.

1. Use breakout rooms for more focused support. 
   * Ask the session host to send the student to the breakout room.
   * A helper can join the breakout rooms on her own, and move among them freely once
     there, via the Breakout Rooms button on the Zoom controls.
   * Screen sharing and remote control options are available to persons in the breakout rooms.
   * Both should be able to leave the breakout room at any time. If not, ask the host to
     change this setting in the Breakout Rooms window.
      
1. Bring the student up to speed via chat. Once the helper and attendee have rejoined the
   main room, use private chat to catch the person up.
